<b>Tools used:</b>

<b>- Vidual Studio Code</b>

Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

<b>- Terminal</b>
A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, 
console user interface, and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program 
where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text.

<b>- Postman</b>

Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself.
It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code 
just to test an API's functionality.

<b>- Git</b>
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small 
to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

<b>npmjs.com</b>

npm (originally short for Node Package Manager)[3] is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. 
It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, 
also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry 
is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. 

Used for:

- Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away.
- Run packages without downloading using npx.
- Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
- Restrict code to specific developers.
- Create Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
- Form virtual teams by using Orgs.
- Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
- Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
- Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.
